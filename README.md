# Keyboard Input Listener Lab (Educational Project)

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This project was developed strictly for educational purposes as part of an internship cybersecurity lab. It is NOT intended for malicious use. The program demonstrates how keyboard input listeners work in controlled environments to understand defensive security mechanisms.

## 📌 Project Purpose

The goal of this lab was to:
- Understand how keyboard event listeners work in Python
- Learn about system-level input handling
- Recognize how such techniques are abused in real-world malware
- Study how security software detects suspicious behavior

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python 3
- pynput library

## 📂 Project Structure
- keylogger.py
- keyfile.txt
- README.md

## 🔐 Ethical Considerations

Keylogging techniques are commonly used in malware. Studying them helps cybersecurity professionals understand:

- Behavioral detection methods
- Antivirus response patterns
- Endpoint protection mechanisms
- Malware analysis techniques

This project was executed in a controlled lab environment only.

## 🚫 Legal Notice

Do not deploy this software on any system without explicit authorization. Unauthorized monitoring of input devices may violate privacy laws.
